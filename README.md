# How to code a feed forward neural network from scratch

This repository provides you with the code needed to follow the tutorial available on Medium: 

This code helps you understand how a simple feed forward neural network architecture works. It can be improved by implementing several useful features: cyclical learning rate, weight decay, momentums and other regualization techniques. Please feel free to contribute if you have any ideas.
